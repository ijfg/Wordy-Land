          ring notifying us when dinner has arrived at our doorstep."

        <h3>extremely loud</h3>
        <blockquote>
          "'Laughing together is as close as you can get without touching,'
          I wrote in my first book…. Laughter has always been the best medicine;
           I wasn't exactly making any boldly original statement almost three
           decades ago. I wasn't expecting a MacArthur grant. But what I
           expected even less … was that the not-touching part of my line would
           eventually be part of a stentorian, global prescription to combat
           COVID-19." — Gina Barreca, The Bedford (Pennsylvania) Gazette,

          "Combining these plots is a terrible idea for multiple reasons. One is
           simply logistical; the fusion turns two improbable but engaging
           stories into a ludicrous farrago." — Laura Miller, Slate, 8 Nov. 2019

          "Should all go well, after three weeks or more, the state would move
          on to phase two, which officials, creating a new virus-age argot,
          have labeled 'Cautious.'" — Matt Stout and Tim Logan, The Boston
