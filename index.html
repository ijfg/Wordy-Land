          "'Let it Be' … was uncannily similar to 'Bridge Over Troubled Water,'
           not only in sentiment, but even to its churchy flavor. 'They're both
           very gospely songs,' [David] Wills says. 'I think 1968 was a very
           turbulent year … and in 1969 there was this life-affirming
           achievement of going to the moon. So I think that was in the
           zeitgeist, those stentorian, stately gospel piano-based songs.'"

          "Combining these plots is a terrible idea for multiple reasons. One is
           simply logistical; the fusion turns two improbable but engaging
           stories into a ludicrous farrago."

          on to phase two, which officials, creating a new virus-age argot,
          have labeled 'Cautious.'"
