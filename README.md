Wordy Land
a place where beautiful words make you feel stupid

Motivation

Wordy Land is my landing page project for front-end developer nano degree at Udacity. I wanted to create something that performs landing page functions, and at the same time do something fun and useful. Hence, I created Wordy Land.

Credits & Inspirations

All text contents are from Merriam-Webster Word of the Day: https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day. It's my favorite dictionary. I love that they are providing so many word-related games and stories. For code inspirations, I have commented in app.js.

Questions

1. scroll-snap: I really wish I could implement "scroll-snap-type: y mandatory" in css. However, it causes my scrollToSection function to glitch. I burnt my brain trying but still wasn't able to fix.

2. viewport-height-vertically-centered-navigation-menu: I wanted the navigation dots to grow from the center whenever new entries are added, but couldn't figure out how.

Thanks for visiting Wordy Land:)
